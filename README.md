# Untrapped - Watch YouTube distraction-free

## The Problem

The brightest brains of our generation are literally working on ways to use Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, and other social media platforms to make you addicted to the news. Social statisticians, scientists, researchers, and people in lab coats are literally doing this. Your brain will be wrecked if you fall to it or become addicted. I believe that this conflict is modern. Social media has manipulated all the systems to make you dependent on it. Therefore, a whole enormous factory of people are striving to make you addicted to these things, while you stand alone. Learning how to first resist these things is hence the modern individual fight. Setting your own boundaries with no assistance from anyone! By developing a browser add-on that disables YouTube distractions like the suggested sidebar, end-screen video suggestions, user comments, homepage related videos feed, trending tab, turn off autoplay, and more, I hope to solve this issue.

## Solution

The extension aims to enhance YouTube's customization and reduce its level of engagement. It offers various features such as the ability to hide suggested videos and customize the user interface according to personal preferences.

## Technology

This browser extension is built using JavaScript, which leverages the Chrome API to provide seamless integration and enhanced functionality within the Google Chrome browser.

The extension utilizes the following key components and technologies:

1. JavaScript: The primary programming language used to develop the extension, enabling dynamic and interactive functionality.
2. Chrome API: This API provides access to various features and capabilities of the Chrome browser, allowing the extension to interact with and modify the behavior of YouTube's interface.
3. HTML and CSS: Used for structuring and styling the extension's user interface and content.

To set up the development environment and start working with the extension, please refer to the installation guide and development documentation provided in the repository.

While this extension is currently designed for Google Chrome, compatibility with other browsers using the WebExtensions API, such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge, may be possible with some adjustments and additional testing.

We welcome contributions and suggestions from the open-source community to enhance the functionality and performance of the extension. Please refer to the contribution guidelines and developer documentation for more details on how to contribute.

Thank you for your interest in the technology behind this project. We hope you find it useful, and we appreciate any feedback or collaboration to make it even better.
